# FTO Psychsheets

### Usage
Run the main.py file with a competition ID as an argument. Example:
```python3 main.py NAC2024```
This will output a new csv file with all the competitors who are attending the competition.

### Limitations
The project currently relies on manually pulling data from the unofficial FTO rankings. The project is bundled with a data file, but this is outdated. The current rankings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JjHTxu-KOpwmHGyGmgBa1N4WTmu3CEKAUyZ1BykRg58/edit?gid=1160150188#gid=1160150188). The program expects a CSV format with a name header and an average header.
